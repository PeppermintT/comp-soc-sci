    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Social Science: it can be a scary, alluring, mystifying term. You may even be thinking, what's the big deal? Surely almost all social science involves the use of computers: we code our interviews using software such as NVivo; build our statistical models in SPSS, Stata etc; and generally conduct our research and teaching activities within a computational environment (e.g., personal desktop/laptop, Dropbox or iCloud for file storage). However, computational social science (CSS) refers to activities and technologies that go beyond what we're typically familiar with as social scientists:\n",
    "* The use of datasets that are too large to store on your personal machine; \n",
    "* Writing programming scripts to access information held in online databases; \n",
    "* Employing analytical techniques, derived from computer science, that reveal structures and patterns in large or unfamiliar datasets (e.g. network analysis, text mining). \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, computational social science is an interdisciplinary branch of research, defined more by its methods and data than its substantive topics (Heiberger & Riebling, 2016). It is not limited to certain analytical approaches (e.g., Machine Learning) or data types (e.g., just text data). So what makes computational social science different from \"traditional\" social science? What types of knowledge and skills do you need to engage in computational methods? And why would you want to be a computational social scientist?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will describe and demonstrate five key domains of computational social science:\n",
    "1. Thinking computationally\n",
    "2. Writing code\n",
    "3. Computational environments\n",
    "4. Manipulating structured and unstructured data\n",
    "5. Reproducibility of the scientific workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "We cover key theories and ideas behind each domain and provide example code, written in the popular Python programming language, that demonstrates some of the key skills computational social scientists need to develop."

    "\n",
    "All computational social science activities are dependent on knowing how to setup, manage and share a computational environment. This can be as simple as understanding how and where files are located on your machine, to defining and documenting which software packages, versions and configurations are necessary to execute your data analysis. Whether you are thinking about scraping a web page or implementing an advanced machine learning algorithm, it all begins with establishing your computational environment. First, let's understand how files are stored and accessed on your machine."

    "### File system and working directory\n",
    "\n",
    "It is critical that you think *logicially* and in an *organised* way about how you manage and store files for your project. This goes beyond just keeping your files and folders tidy using a graphic user interface, and requires that you know how to move around in and interpret command line interfaces. Although this may look a bit unfamiliar or even scary, the black window with stark contrast text and a blinky cursor will become your friend!\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing to know is that files and folders stored on your machine's hard drive can and be accessed in two ways:\n",
    "* Absolute path \n",
    "* Relative path\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the absolute and relative path are like directions to the location of a file or folder, but they differ in that relative path assumes that whoever is giving directions is in the same place as whoever is getting the directions while absolute path does not. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if someone were to ask me \"Where is your office?\" I would answer differently in different contexts. If I was talking on the phone to someone who wanted to send a book to my office, I would respond with an absolute path type answer and give the full postal address of my office. But if someone where standing in the lobby of my building and asked me where to drop something off after lunch, I would give a relative path answer and say which floor and which hallway to take out of the stairwell, plus my office number. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is not always easy to know whether you (the one giving the directions) are in the same file system location as the computer (the one giving directions), so you need to know how to ask for the current working directory (i.e., where *this* notebook, that you are working in right now is located).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do that is to ask by double clicking in the code cell below, just after the end of %cd%. Then either \n",

Each environment has Python installed but they have different Python packages. I do not perform any web-scraping for the Companies House project, therefore I did not install the `requests` or `BeautifulSoup` packages in that environment. \n",

By keeping them separate, I can install or update only the packages I need, when I need them, without worrying that it will break the chain of requirements for one project by improving it for another. If I were to use one environment for all the different kinds of work I do, some of my scripts may break whenever I try to upgrade or install something that I need for only one project. Running separate environments for different projects allows me to manage these package dependencies carefully and correctly.\n",
