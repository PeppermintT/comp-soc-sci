    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Social Science: it can be a scary, alluring, mystifying term. You may even be thinking, what's the big deal? Surely almost all social science involves the use of computers: we code our interviews using software such as NVivo; build our statistical models in SPSS, Stata etc; and generally conduct our research and teaching activities within a computational environment (e.g., personal desktop/laptop, Dropbox or iCloud for file storage). However, computational social science (CSS) refers to activities and technologies that go beyond what we're typically familiar with as social scientists:\n",
    "* The use of datasets that are too large to store on your personal machine; \n",
    "* Writing programming scripts to access information held in online databases; \n",
    "* Employing analytical techniques, derived from computer science, that reveal structures and patterns in large or unfamiliar datasets (e.g. network analysis, text mining). \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, computational social science is an interdisciplinary branch of research, defined more by its methods and data than its substantive topics (Heiberger & Riebling, 2016). It is not limited to certain analytical approaches (e.g., Machine Learning) or data types (e.g., just text data). So what makes computational social science different from \"traditional\" social science? What types of knowledge and skills do you need to engage in computational methods? And why would you want to be a computational social scientist?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will describe and demonstrate five key domains of computational social science:\n",
    "1. Thinking computationally\n",
    "2. Writing code\n",
    "3. Computational environments\n",
    "4. Manipulating structured and unstructured data\n",
    "5. Reproducibility of the scientific workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "We cover key theories and ideas behind each domain and provide example code, written in the popular Python programming language, that demonstrates some of the key skills computational social scientists need to develop."

    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most crucial aspect of being a computational social scientist, the ability to write code can bring enourmous rewards. _Description/definition of programming and how it is similar to writing syntax for SPSS, Stata etc_\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming can be conceived as a social research method:\n",
    "\n",
    "> as a multipurpose toolkit for understanding and intervening in the (digital) social world in lots of different ways (Brooker, 2019, p.#).<sup>[2]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "[2]: https://doi.org/10.1177/0038026119840988\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of \"Programming-as-Social Science\" carries with it two important distinctions (Brooker, 2019):\n",
    "1. **Coding-as-method** - using code to interact with or probe the social world (e.g. through data collection scripts).\n",
    "2. **Programming-as-analysis** - employing a coding mindset/knowledge of code to conceptualise and research social phenomena differently (e.g. ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the objective of any research project is to produce a robust and defensible finding (theoretical or empirical), the manner in which you conduct your activities is increasingly important. This impinges on the code you write, also. There is a school of thought that emphasises the readability and fluency of code, known as _literate programming (LP)_. The father of this approach, Donald Knuth (n.d.), summarises its high level aim:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.<sup>[3]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a statement probably appears grandoise and abstract, but there are important practical implications of this idea. The coder (or essayist in LP parlance):\n",
    "\n",
    "> chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what each variable means. He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a literate programmer does not mean writing screeds of comments and headings for the sake of it, far from it (remember: conciseness is paramount). We'll cover this topic in more detail in section 1.3.5 (add anchor).\n",
